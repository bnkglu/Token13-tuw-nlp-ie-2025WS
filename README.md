# Topic 8 - Explainable Relation Extraction
**Instructors** Gábor Recski

## Overview 
Relation extraction is the task of finding pairs of entities in text that are in one of a few predefined semantic relationships. RE is a common task in industry NLP applications, but the so-called “state-of-the-art” models often cannot be deployed due to their lack of configurability and predictability. The goal of this task is to develop rule systems for relation extraction by leveraging machine learning models for creating patterns that can then be applied to input text. Some helpful tools for building rule-based systems can be the [spaCy functionality](https://spacy.io/api/dependencymatcher) for building patterns on dependency trees or the [POTATO](https://github.com/adaamko/POTATO) library for extracting and crafting graph patterns for text classification. But building a rule-based system from scratch or based on the code of any existing open-source system is also fine.
