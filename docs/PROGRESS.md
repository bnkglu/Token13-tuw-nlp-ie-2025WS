## 22 Oct 2025
- GitHub repo created.

## 26 Oct 2025 - Initial Meeting
- Dataset was selected: SemEval 2010 Task 8 (source: https://semeval2.fbk.eu/Data.html).

- Until next meeting: All plan preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, extraction of given entities/relation) by 29 Oct and divide tasks.
- Considered: SemEval 2026 (feasibility TBD).
- Send an email to professor for dataset approval.

## 01.11.2025 - Final Meeting before Milestone 1
- Decided on which implementation to use for Milestone 1.
- Discussed plans for Milestone 2:
    1. Everyone will research baseline models can be implemented for relation extraction. After that, we will divide the models to implement.
    2. Milestone 2: meeting is on 10.11.2025 14:00-15:30.


**Note from Lecture Text Classification:**
- For Milestone 2 of the Project exercise you should perform error analysis on your baseline models and discuss your findings, including implications for how your solution could be improved.
